# Duality-AI
##  Overview

This repository contains a full pipeline for detecting essential safety equipment aboard space stations using the YOLOv8 object detection architecture. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic datasets generated using Duality AI‚Äôs Falcon digital twin, ensuring robustness in occluded, dimly lit, and cluttered space environments.

##  Problem Statement

Identifying critical safety equipment such as fire extinguishers, oxygen tanks, and toolboxes onboard space stations is vital for crew safety. Manual inspections are time-consuming and risky. Real-world data is scarce due to the difficulty of space access. This project proposes a solution by:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Using synthetic data generated by Falcon simulations
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Training YOLOv8 variants with state-of-the-art fine-tuning
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Creating a fully automated object detection pipeline

##  Model Training & Fine-Tuning

We trained the YOLOv8s model with a focus on retaining general object detection capabilities while adapting it to a synthetic domain:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Freeze-10 Strategy*: First 10 layers frozen to preserve base features like edges and textures.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Transfer Learning*: Based on the paper "Fine-Tuning Without Forgetting", applied adaptation techniques to retain COCO knowledge.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†*Epochs*: 100


##  Web Interface

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Built using HTML/CSS/JS + FastAPI backend.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Displays real-time object detection from input images.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Inventory dashboard with item counts and exportable logs.
