# Duality-AI
##  Overview

This repository contains a full pipeline for detecting essential safety equipment aboard space stations using the YOLOv8 object detection architecture. The model is trained exclusively on synthetic datasets generated using Duality AI‚Äôs Falcon digital twin, ensuring robustness in occluded, dimly lit, and cluttered space environments.

##  Problem Statement

Identifying critical safety equipment such as fire extinguishers, oxygen tanks, and toolboxes onboard space stations is vital for crew safety. Manual inspections are time-consuming and risky. Real-world data is scarce due to the difficulty of space access. This project proposes a solution by:

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Using synthetic data generated by Falcon simulations
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Training YOLOv8 variants with state-of-the-art fine-tuning
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Creating a fully automated object detection pipeline

##  Model Training & Fine-Tuning

*YOLOv8s Model (Baseline Fine-Tuning)*
This model serves as our primary baseline. The strategy involves standard fine-tuning of the pre-trained YOLOv8s (small) model on our custom synthetic dataset.

*Methodology*:

The base yolov8s.pt model was loaded.

It was re-trained on the custom dataset for 100 epochs.

Performance was measured on the unseen test set to evaluate final accuracy.


*2. SOTA Fine-Tuning (YOLOv8m)*
This approach uses a more advanced fine-tuning technique inspired by the research paper "FINE-TUNING WITHOUT FORGETTING". It leverages the larger YOLOv8m (medium) model and freezes the initial layers to preserve foundational knowledge.

*Methodology*:

The powerful YOLOv8m model was used for this experiment.

The first 10 layers of the model were frozen (Freeze=10 strategy).

This preserves the model's expert knowledge of basic features like edges and colors, focusing training efforts on deeper, more specialized layers.

This method aims for faster, more efficient learning with a lower risk of overfitting.


*3. YOLOv8m with Strong Augmentation*
This strategy combines the high potential of the YOLOv8m model with aggressive data augmentation to create a more robust model that can handle challenging real-world conditions.

*Methodology*:

The larger YOLOv8m model was used to provide a high baseline for accuracy.

Strong augmentations were applied during training to create challenging scenarios.

These augmentations included techniques like adding fog, rotating images, and applying random dropout.

Performance:

*4. YOLOv8n Model (For Context)*
While not part of the direct comparative study with performance metrics, the YOLOv8n (nano) model was also considered and is important for context.

Characteristics:

YOLOv8n is the smallest, fastest, and most lightweight model in the YOLOv8 series.

It is specifically designed for high-speed, real-time detection on devices with limited computational power, such as mobile phones, drones, or other edge devices.

Its primary advantage is speed and efficiency, which comes at the cost of slightly lower accuracy compared to the larger s and m models.

##  Web Interface

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Built using HTML/CSS/JS + FastAPI backend.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Displays real-time object detection from input images.
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Inventory dashboard with item counts and exportable logs.
